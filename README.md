# Yapping 
I was told, that noone would actually play the game, so I didn't even bother digging into 'DoozyUI'  
Also, I don't get, why do I need to use everything I know for a such simple project, there's no point in overengineering something as simple as BB  
One may argue, I already overengineered a bunch, but I used the template that I wrote specifically, to boot up a project and just do the thing  

Time spent approx 4-4.5 hours
